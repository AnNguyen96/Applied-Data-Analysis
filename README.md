  Monthly Utility Bill Prediction
</h1>

**Project Description**: This project is part of an assignment in the Applied Data Analysis course at Monash University. Commercial electricity prices in Australia are rising to a record high. Australia is a significant energy supplier globally, this a supply shortage is not the cause of the current issue. Concerns about affordability are at its core. Therefore, knowing the main factors (other than money) that affect electricity bills is an important first step to improving the above problems. My task in this project is to develop a monthly electricity bill estimation model based on the given possible predictors. From there, make inferences that generate detailed information about the relationship between response and predictor variables.
